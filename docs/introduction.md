## A brief history of Go
* Began life at Google and is widely used there.
* Conceived in 2007, publicly announced 2009, and v1 was released in 2012
* Designers cited their dislike of C++ as a primary motivation for designing Go

## Core tenets
**Compiled** - Go compiles to a binary that can run on all common operating systems.

**Concurrency-forward** - Go handles the heavy lifting for matching routines to threads. You get to focus on the logic.

**Object-oriented/imperative** - While you can apply many functional concepts here, Go is unabashedly object-oriented.

**Statically-typed** - Everything has a type! 

## I C what you did there
Go takes its cues from C, Python, and Java; but adopted patterns from dynamically typed languages:

* type inference
* semicolons are inferred
* fast compilation
* remote package management and online documentation

## Already ready already
* Robust native tooling
* Built-in concurrency primitives
* Language provides tools for building, formatting, running, documenting, etc
* Native unit testing library (though supplementing it is recommended)
* Built-in dependency management

## Upsides
* Easy to learn
* Large, excited community
* Simple concurrency
* Robust plug-ins for most popular IDEs
* **FUN**

## Downsides
* Unit testing with mocks has a learning curve
* Error handling may be bulky for some
* Concurrency is easy to learn, difficult to master
