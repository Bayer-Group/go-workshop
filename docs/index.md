## Language Overview
Go, commonly written as Golang, is a type-safe language that excels at concurrency, websocket, and gRPC implementations. Go fits well with most API use cases, especially when heavy load begs for concurrent operations. Go is also supported for AWS Lambda functions.

The language sports a robust set of native libraries including a simple-to-use http library, a generic sql interface (supplemented by a database-specific driver library), crypto functions, and more. Simple APIs can be built quickly from just built-in packages.

Since Go can be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly), it is possible to build Go modules to be run in the browser.

## To get started
The workshop repository with hands-on examples is [here](https://github.com/Bayer-Group/go-workshop) with setup instructions.

## Workshop Structure
The 'Basics' module starts with the components that you will see across most common languages then delves into 'Intermediate' where we explore the concepts and structures that set Go apart. The 'Advanced' module builds on those concepts and introduces several new built-in components.

The intended flow of the workshop is to go through each module's presentation on the site one part at a time and then complete the TODOs in the associated exercise. The code can be run via the Makefile for simplicity.
